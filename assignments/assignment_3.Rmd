Compute power given a truck of m=31752 and a vehicle of m=15000 kg (parameters for a heavy truck) for a range of different highway speeds, The surface area of this truck is 16 m2
30 m/s
80 km/hr
120 km/hr
40 km/hr
5 km/hr

```{r}
#speeds for both vehicles
speeds <- speed_conversion(speed=c(80, 120, 40, 5))
speeds <- append(speeds,30)
```

```{r}
#power for vehicle 1 (heavy)
power1 <- auto_power_gen(mass=31752, speed=speeds, A=16)
```

```{r}
#power for vehicle 2 (lighter)
power2 <- auto_power_gen(mass=15000, speed=speeds, A=16)
```

```{r}
#combine powers and speed into one data frame for visualization
power_speed <- data.frame(power1, power2, speeds)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=power_speed) +
  geom_line( aes(x=speeds, y = power1, color = "Heavy Truck")) +
  geom_line(aes(x=speeds, y = power2, color = "Lighter Vehicle")) +
  labs(x = "Speed (meters/second)",
       y = "Power (W)", 
       title = "Power generation by light and heavy automobile",
       color = "") +
