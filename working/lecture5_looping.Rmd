```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Example
Calculate NPV for
- a range of different interest rates and
- a range of damages
- that may be incurred 10 years in the future

Steps
- define inputs (interest rates, damages)
- define output (NPV)
- write the function
- create a data structure to store results where we vary both interest rates and damages
- use nested for loops to fill in the data structure

```{r}
#test function 
NPV(20, interest=0.01, n=20)
```

```{r}
#define values 
damages = c(25,33,91,24)

interests = seq(from=0.01, to=0.04, by=0.005)
```

```{r}
 #some data wrangling to make it pretty
colnames(npvs)=discount_rates
rownames(npvs)=damages
```
